# Predicting Medical Charges Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict medical charges based on patient information using **Linear Regression**. The dataset includes demographic, health-related, and behavioral attributes that influence medical expenses.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following features:

- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (Female/Male).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, which estimates body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children**: Number of dependent children.
- **Smoker**: Whether the patient is a smoker (Yes/No).
- **Region**: The region where the patient resides.
- **Charges**: The total medical expenses charged (Target variable).

## Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   
2. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**

3. **Model Experimentation**

4. **Final Model Selection**
